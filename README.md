# Design Teardown

A design teardown of [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com) created through [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com) online course. The main objective of this project is to break down the Smashing Magazine website and create a grayscale heat map of the page, focusing on HTML/CSS and ignoring all JavaScript functionality. This project is for learning purposes only.
